    <p>At the start of this project my team and I were tasked with developing a new feature for Snapchat aimed at tackling issues related to food security.</p>
    <p>To challenge this, our team created FoodSmart - a Snapchat feature that improves food resource discoverability and access.</p>
    <p>As a product designer, I worked cross-functionally to develop seamless in-app tools and a supportive community.</p>
