# About
## Bio
### Hello there, I’m Betty. Originally from South Korea, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in User Experience and Interaction Design.

### If you’d like to learn more about my journey to finding my passion in UX, please scroll a bit further. Thanks for being here.

#### How it started
In August 2022, as a high school senior, I stood before my parents, sharing a decision that had been years in the making. After much internal debate, I decided to pursue their long-held dream for me — to become a dentist.

#### A glimpse back
Though the announcement was made, I was still unsure of my decision. I reflected on a pivotal period, where I spent countless hours alongside my dad, delivering food through DoorDash, UberEats, and Postmates during quarantine. It was a time of struggle for many, and I saw firsthand the challenges that delivery drivers in my community faced daily — stress, overwhelm, and the lack of support.

#### The shift to UX
Inspired, I began exploring UX design, looking for ways to improve the lives of food delivery drivers. Through this experience, I discovered a deep fascination with understanding different contexts and satisfaction in solving problems that could improve lives.

#### A tribute to my roots
Today, I carry those experiences with me, paying homage to my immigrant background and childhood passion for helping underrepresented and marginalized communities. Through design, I strive to give voice to those who often go unheard, creating solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.

#### What fuels me
Outside of design, I find joy in the simple pleasures — like the feel of quality leather, the charm of a funky lamp, or the ease of an all-black wardrobe, electric guitar, fashion, art, and the serenity of nature.

# Visual Design
## Visual Design
### I like exploring different design techniques and concepts. Here are a few selected projects I’ve done in my free time or as contract work.

##### Warmth
After moving to the United States from South Korea in 2015, I wanted to reconnect with the memories of my childhood through art. This project explores 3D modeling as a way to recreate some of my favorite places from my early years, capturing the warmth and nostalgia of home through detailed digital environments.

#### Cho & Co.
In the summer of 2023, I was tasked with developing the visual identity for Cho & Co., a creative management and consultancy company. The mockups I made were designed to show the key parts of the company’s look and feel, bringing their brand to life.

#### Outsiders & Insiders
In fall 2023, I teamed up with Jun, the founder of Outsiders & Insiders, to design their website and build their online presence. The mockups below were created to give the website a clear and consistent look that matches the brand’s style.

#### Birthday Poster
Description: One of my creative hobbies this year has been designing personalized birthday posters for close friends. Though many lean toward playful and humorous styles, the poster below was created with Julianna in mind, blending elements that reflect her personality and our shared memories.

#### 1987: The Road to Full Bloom
1987: The Road to Full Bloom aims to show young Koreans and other societies around the globe that we must not lose sight of the past and continue to stay vigilant. It draws from the events of the Gwangju Uprising of 1980, where South Korean citizens bravely rose up against the military dictatorship, demanding democracy and freedom. Though met with violent repression, the spirit of the movement paved the way for lasting political change. This project serves as a cautionary tale with universal relevance, reminding us of the sacrifices necessary to influence real political transformation.

#### As Human Spirit Molds
As Human Spirit Molds is a personal exploration of my journey, blending mixed media, digital value translations, and scanning to reflect on my childhood, migration from Korea to the U.S., and my growth and resilience. The monochromatic palette sets a reflective tone, while the zine cover serves as a visual gateway into layers of memory and emotion. As the cursor moves through these layers, it symbolizes the fluid nature of memory and personal transformation. The project delves into storytelling and typography to highlight how narratives shape our identity. 

"Tales" represent both real and fictional stories that contribute to personal growth, while "Molds" signifies both the act of shaping and the structured forms that influence our perspective. The project reflects on my struggles as a young immigrant, underscoring how these experiences molded my understanding of the world. Through visual storytelling and typography, As Human Spirit Molds invites viewers to reflect on the power of narratives in shaping the human spirit, finding beauty and peace in the unique threads of the human experience.

#### Self Portrait
Creating a self-portrait has always been a challenge for me, as it brings up deep questions about my identity and how I perceive my true self. I feel like this is a question that may never have a clear answer because humans are always changing. In this self-portrait, I explore the idea of "loose sight"—something I can’t fully picture yet. The use of threads in the design represents the effort and time it takes to understand and discover who we truly are.

#### Sonder
In this project, I explored complementary colors using Adobe Premiere. I used image tracing and color overlays to create a visual video inspired by a poem I wrote about "sonder"—the realization that each person you see has a life as rich and real as your own, where they are the main character, and others, including yourself, play smaller roles.

**Poem:**

In the vast expanse of moments spun, Sonder whispers, a tale begun.

Strangers passing, lives unseen, Worlds within, a silent screen. 

Each step a dance of unseen stories, Echoes of dreams, unseen glories.

Invisible threads, a web of connection, A universe within, defying reflection. 

The heartbeats merge in rhythmic flow, A symphony of souls, in ebb and glow.

Mysteries wrapped in veils of time, Sonder’s embrace, a silent chime. 

Through crowded streets and empty spaces,Sonder blooms in unseen embraces.

A tapestry woven, threads entwined, In the mosaic of life, secrets find. 

For every gaze, a universe untold, Sonder’s magic, a truth behold.In quiet moments, hearts entwine, A dance of souls, in fleeting time.

#### The Whatever
Finding my own sense of fashion has been a long journey. After trying countless styles and chasing trends, I eventually grew tired of it all. Starting in my senior year of high school, I committed to wearing only black or white outfits. While I’m still not sure what led me to this decision, it has since become a core part of my identity. Although fashion shouldn't define a person entirely, I take pride in being recognized through my outfits. This project showcases the different silhouettes and styles I’ve embraced, reflecting my dedication to my personal sense of fashion.

# Interface Design
## Interface Design
### Between my time as a Design Scholar at Snapchat and my current studies in UXID as an undergraduate, I've selected a few key projects from my case studies.

#### FoodSmart
At the start of this project my team and I were tasked with developing a new feature for Snapchat aimed at tackling issues related to food security. To challenge this, our team created FoodSmart - a Snapchat feature that improves food resource discoverability and access. As a product designer, I worked cross-functionally to develop seamless in-app tools and a supportive community.

#### RAINN Redesign
This project was initiated as part of my UI Design 1 class, where I was tasked with redesigning an existing website. I chose to focus on the non-profit RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), as it aligned with my passion for supporting marginalized communities. I aimed to enhance the user experience by improving visual hierarchy and reducing cognitive overload, creating a welcoming space for survivors seeking help.

#### Unity
This was a personal passion project started back in the beginning of 2023 where I noticed frustrations and disappointment amongst third-party food delivery drivers and decided to identify problems and solve them through UX/UI exploration. The project aimed to designing a community and educational platform for third-party food delivery drivers seeking support and guidance
