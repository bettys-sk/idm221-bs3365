        <p>As Human Spirit Molds is a personal exploration of my journey, blending mixed media, digital value translations, and scanning to reflect on my childhood, migration from Korea to the U.S., and my growth and resilience.</p>
        <p>The monochromatic palette sets a reflective tone, while the zine cover serves as a visual gateway into layers of memory and emotion. As the cursor moves through these layers, it symbolizes the fluid nature of memory and personal transformation.</p>
        <p>The project delves into storytelling and typography to highlight how narratives shape our identity.</p>
