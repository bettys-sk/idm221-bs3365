        <p>Creating a self-portrait has always been a challenge for me, as it brings up deep questions about my identity and how I perceive my true self.</p>
        <p>I feel like this is a question that may never have a clear answer because humans are always changing.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="s-img" src="./images/sp_1.jpg" alt="self portrait">
    <p>In this self-portrait, I explore the idea of "loose sight"â€”something I can't fully picture yet.</p>
    <p>The use of threads in the design represents the effort and time it takes to understand and discover who we truly are.</p>
