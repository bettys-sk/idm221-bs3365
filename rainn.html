    <p>This project was initiated as part of my UI Design 1 class, where I was tasked with redesigning an existing website.</p>
    <p>I chose to focus on the non-profit RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), as it aligned with my passion for supporting marginalized communities.</p>
    <p>I aimed to enhance the user experience by improving visual hierarchy and reducing cognitive overload, creating a welcoming space for survivors seeking help.</p>
